# time-tracking-program
Nana a business man who owns a consultancy firm. He charges a fixed rate per hour for every consultancy that he carries out. Nana has realised that to make his work easier, he needs a Time Tracker program. This will enable him to enter the time at which he started and ended a task, and with that information calculate the amount of money he earns within that period. 
1. You are required to enter 1 to start the timer
2. When you are done with your work all you need to do is to press any key (intiger) to end or stop the timer
3. You then have to access the csv file to see the time you spent and the sum accrued.

Plans a are far advanced to create a GUI which will be more easer for you.
